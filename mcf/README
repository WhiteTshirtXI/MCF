After download MCF/mcf/ folder,
I suppose you have already installed PPM library
in a proper path,
which needs to be given when you configure mcf client.
I also suppose you have installed makedepf90,
which is to check routines dependency of mcf/src/*.F90.

1) run script
 
  ./clean.sh

to clean all old files, which may be machine dependant.

2) run script

  ./bootstrap.sh

to make use of GNU autoconf + automake,
which generates configure script.

3) run configuration.

./configure --prefix=$HOME/MCF/mcf/mcf_install/ FC=ifort MPIFC=mpif90 LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/MCF/ppm/local/lib/ FCFLAGS=-I$HOME/MCF/ppm/local/include/ MAKEDEPF90=$HOME/MCF/ppm/local/bin/makedepf90

to generate Makefile, which is used to compile mcf code.

LDFLAGS: indicate ppm library object files.
FCFLAGS: indicate ppm library header files.


4) run compiler

  make -j 8

to compile mcf code,
-j 8 specify to use 8 processors to accelerate compiling.

5) run installation

  make install

to install mcf executable binary at ...../mcf/mcf_install/ folder.
