\section{Introduction}
A code named multiscale complex fluids simulation~(MCF)
has been developed and is still being developed in
Marco Ellero's Emmy Noether group
at Prof. Adams' Chair of Aerodynamics,
Technical University Munich.
This article is created
to facilitate the understanding and 
even further development of the code,
which is written in Fortran 90 and
uses a highly efficient parallel particle mesh~(PPM)\cite{Sbalzarini2006} library.
The numerical algorithme of MCF is based on
mesh free Lagrangian particle method,
particularly smoothed particle hydrodynamics~(SPH)
and its extended version smoothed dissipative particle dynamics~(SDPD).
