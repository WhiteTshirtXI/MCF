This directory contains a C++ implementation of Vizing's approximate
solution algorithm to the minimal edge coloring problem. This approximate
solution uses at most one color more than the optimal solution would. 

Implementation from:
The Stony Brook Algorithm Repository 
http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/implement/stony/distrib/Vizing/
The unchanged original implementation can be found in ./original/

Changes made by IFS:
  (1) vizing_coloring.cc newly added as wrapper which is callable from F90
  (2) added getResult method to ColorGraph class (in color.h) in order to
      be able to store the result and not only print it to the screen.
